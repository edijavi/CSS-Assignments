## CSS-Assignments
1. Read more about CSS and try to answer as many questions as you can from the CSS - Terminology & Definitions file, which you can find attached in the email.
2. Assignment (Colors):
    1. Create 4 headings from h1 to h4
    2. Have all headings have different colors, according to your taste
    3. When giving values to colors of these headings, make sure all use a different type of
    values (keyword, hex, rgb, hsl)
    4. Put all headings in a div and color the div to your liking
3. Assignment (Links & Images):
    1. Open your project from the previous HTML assignments (links-and-images)
    2. Add any inline style for h1 of your homepage
    3. Create a directory named css within the links-and-images directory and create a
    cascade stylesheet named ‘style.css’ which all of your HTML files will be linked to
    4. Within that style.css add properties to customize the page to your liking, make sure that
    you include the following:
        1. Background color
        2. Text color
        3. Font family
        4. Font size
        5. Borders
        6. Rounded corners on images
    5. Remember that you can customize the pages to your liking, you will not be graded in
    any way on how it looks as it’s a personal preference, but make sure to use at least all of
    the properties mentioned above in the list
4. Assignment (Main CSS Project):
    1. Download the ‘Roboto’ font from here
    2. Check out here on how to use that font you just downloaded
    3. Have a look at the two images below (3rd/4th) page of this document). One is the design
    that you will try to copy, it should look as similar as possible. The second one shows
    some information like colors and font-weights you should use in texts.
    4. Do not worry about this being responsive on mobile devices or not, that is not the goal
    here
    5. For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before
    beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably
    have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from
    the beginning will take more time and may cause more frustration.
    6. There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at
    a blank HTML document and not know where to start. Our suggestion: take it one
    section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick
    one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a
    solid plan.
